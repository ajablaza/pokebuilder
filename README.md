# PokéBuilder

## Project Overview

**PokeBuilder** is a Pokémon team-building application that allows users to create and customize teams of up to six Pokémon, including their movesets. It supports multiple Pokémon generations and is designed for casual play, Nuzlocke challenges, or strategic planning for speedruns.

> **Note:** This project is currently being reworked. It was originally built when I was a beginner, so some parts are being improved and refactored for better structure, maintainability, and features.
